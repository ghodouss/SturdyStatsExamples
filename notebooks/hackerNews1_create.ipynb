      "“The FDA approval of our US IND for SPG601 for FXS represents a significant milestone for the company as we look to expand our pipeline of game-changing therapeutics that aim to restore synaptic function,” said Stella Sarraf, PhD, founder, CEO, Spinogenix, in a press release. “Current treatments leave a critical gap in effective and patient-friendly solutions for neurodevelopmental conditions. Like many other conditions, loss of synaptic function remains a key driver of disease, and for that reason we are excited to launch our first U.S. trial to address this unmet need in FXS.

      "The company’s research remains in early stages. In the year and a half since it emerged from stealth, the Enlaza has begun putting a pipeline together and run some preclinical studies. Duron contends those studies have displayed “the advantages of covalent protein drugs,” but the company is still a few years away from the types of human trials that can more definitively prove its claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Founded in 2007 and for years run by GV general partner David Schenkein, Agios successfully developed and won approvals of two leukemia drugs in about a decade. But Agios struggled to sell them and continued to lose money, ultimately leading the company to shift its focus to rare diseases and in 2020 sell its cancer drug portfolio to French drugmaker Servier for $1.8 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mirador isn’t saying which conditions it’ll go after first, or which drug targets it’s identified. McKenna only revealed that those targets have “strong genetic ties” to the diseases it’s interested in. But he envisions advancing multiple new drug prospects over the next 18 months and also indicated the company, with its large bankroll, may do deals to bring in more advanced candidates as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most diseases of the brain and nervous system, Parkinson’s has proven difficult to treat, let alone cure. In just the last couple years, an experimental drug from the biotech Neuraly failed a key study; Biogen chose to prematurely end a late-stage trial of a therapy called BIIB122; and AbbVie backed away from a research alliance with Sweden’s BioArctic.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Endeavor, Hood is following a similar strategy as the last biotech he founded, Impact Biosciences. He formed that company around a myelofibrosis drug that was licensed from Sanofi. Impact’s progress eventually drew the interest of Celgene, which acquired the company for $7 billion in 2018. The drug, Inrebic, was approved a year later and is now sold by Bristol Myers Squibb.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, the company has more than half a dozen experimental medicines in mid- to late-stage testing. The list includes a drug named amlitelimab, which Sanofi acquired through the billion-dollar acquisition of a U.K.-based biotechnology company in 2021. Last summer, the drug hit the main goal of a study focused on moderate-to-severe eczema.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alumis claims its drug, called ESK-001, could be more potent and selective than Sotyktu, though that hasn’t yet been proven in testing. It also faces several other competitors. Takeda has a drug in late-stage testing that it acquired from Nimbus Therapeutics. Privately held biotechs Sudo Biosciences and Priovant Therapeutics, among others, are also working on next-generation TYK2 inhibitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roche last year acquired those medicines in a $2.7 billion deal for biotechnology company Carmot Therapeutics. One, CT-388, is an injectable therapy, while the other, CT-996, is a pill. Since May, both have since shown the potential in early trials to spur significant weight loss, adding billions to Roche’s market value and making the company a surprise player in one of the most lucrative areas of drug research.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of cancer-focused acquisitions and partnerships followed, bringing in a raft of experimental cancer drugs that Parsey was tasked with advancing through clinical development. While Gilead has had some success, several of those deals haven’t panned out and Trodelvy, the chief asset acquired in a $21 billion buyout of Immunomedics, has come up short in key clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s first attempt at proving that is a pair of ADCs that aimed at targets the drug industry has struggled with. One candidate homes in on a protein called NaPi2b that is implicated in ovarian and lung cancer. The other seeks out 5T4, which is expressed in many different cancers. Despite showing early promise, other companies developing ADCs for those targets haven’t been successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In targeting autoimmune disease, Merck is joining what’s fast becoming one of the more crowded areas of drug research. In the last couple years, more than a dozen clinical trials have begun involving cell therapies for conditions like lupus and myasthenia gravis. But drugmakers are also looking at dual-targeting antibody drugs with similar goals, hoping those medicines might prove to be more convenient, easier-to-manufacture alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexion also had drugs in its pipeline, such as Voydeya, that were meant to defend against rising competition from companies like Novartis, Roche and Amgen. The company had acquired Voydeya, previously known as danicopan, when it bought Achillion Pharmaceuticals for nearly $1 billion in 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "For AbbVie, the drug could help round out a portfolio of Parkinson’s medicines that includes the drug Duodopa. The pharmaceutical company also recently acquired a small biotech called Mitokinin that’s working on a different kind of Parkinson’s therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zenas is led by Lonnie Moulder, the former head of a cancer biotech, Tesaro, that GSK acquired in 2018. The company has two other drugs in clinical testing that are partnered with other biotechs. Zenas also has an alliance with Bristol Myers Squibb, which invested in the company and acquired partial rights to obexelimab last year.\n",

      "Roivant is a so-called hub-and-spoke biotech, with a web of subsidiaries custom-built to advance specific drug candidates in different therapeutic areas. In Roivant’s case, those prospects are typically plucked from the shelves of pharmaceutical companies.\n",

      "At least a dozen biotechnology startups, a handful of publicly traded companies and now multiple large drugmakers are developing radiopharmaceuticals. Some are going after the same targets as Pluvicto and another Novartis therapy, Lutathera, but with different drug components. Others are pursuing different cancer-associated proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, there’s been a surge in investments in companies aiming to surpass Sotyktu. Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda paid $4 billion to acquire an experimental drug developed by Nimbus Therapeutics. Takeda has since presented the data that convinced it to make the deal, and planned a bevy of additional trials.\n",

      "Kyverna is the fifth biotech company to file for an IPO in January, suggesting companies may be more willing to test investors’ appetite for new stock offerings amid recent market optimism. Last year, only 22 drugmakers priced offerings, the lowest total in at least six years, according to BioPharma Dive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a fast start this year, the pace of biotech IPOs has slowed, with 11 companies raising about $1.6 billion in combined proceeds. While fewer companies had priced an IPO by the same point last year, more did in each of the five years prior, according to BioPharma Dive data. Only one biotech, Rapport Therapeutics, has gone public in the last two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The venture capital activity stands in stark contrast to the slow pace of initial public offerings for biotechnology companies. A stock downturn that began in late 2021 largely persisted through 2023, leaving companies with fewer options for growth. While the sector’s flagship stock indexes showed some signs of improvement in recent months, they’re still far off the highs reached in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "That interest has trickled down to startups. Immune drugmakers Acelyrin, Apogee Therapeutics and Kyverna Therapeutics priced three of the largest initial public offerings since the start of 2023, BioPharma Dive data show. And in the first half of 2024, Mirador Therapeutics, Capstan Therapeutics and Lycia Therapeutics each raised funding rounds exceeding $100 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite an icy IPO market last year, CG made no secret of its ambition to go public as far back as August. The company was one of the few that opted for a pre-IPO crossover funding round last year, a financing model that proved popular during the biotech boom years.\n",

      "\n",
      "A run of offerings in the first six weeks of 2024, most worth around $100 million or more, has put the sector on its strongest pace since 2021. Those IPOs, combined with the recovery of biotech’s two flagship stock funds and a dealmaking surge, have given industry watchers reasons to be optimistic.\n",

      "\n",
      "Investors interviewed at the meeting were hesitant to make predictions on biotech initial public offerings, which have dropped dramatically since their 2021 peak, according to BioPharma Dive data. While there were some signs of market momentum last year, each spurt of IPO activity quickly lapsed into longer dry spells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Venture capital investors invested less money in private biotechs across fewer deals last year than in 2022 and 2021, according to data compiled by J.P. Morgan in a report released Friday. Companies found their backers required greater discipline and clearer line of sight to milestones like beginning clinical trials. Crossover investors, who often help fund startups en route to an IPO, pulled back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sands Capital invests in private as well as publicly-traded companies, making the firm one of the “crossover investors” young drugmakers turn to when preparing for an initial public offering. A 2021 analysis from Pitchbook found Sands Capital to be among the most prevalent crossover investors over the previous six years, a particularly active time for biotech IPOs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contineum’s offering keeps biotech IPOs on their strongest pace in three years, according to BioPharma Dive data. By this time last year, only four drug startups had gone public, raising $375 million. In 2022, nine companies had pulled in $744 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyverna’s success hints at what biotech investors are looking for. As of Friday, eight of the last 12 companies to go public have had medicines in Phase 2 testing or later. Seven of those eight raised at least $100 million and five surpassed $250 million, BioPharma Dive data show. So far, their stock prices have mostly held value or climbed higher, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm’s most recent fund has closed during a cautiously optimistic time for drug startups. There are signs of a recovery, with recent data from the Biotechnology Innovation Organization suggesting venture fundings may be stabilizing to pre-pandemic norms after a prolonged pullback. Dealmaking has also surged, with buyouts of private biotechs at their fastest pace in at least six years, BioPharma Dive data show.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, ORI saw another one of its investments, cancer drug startup CG Oncology, raise $380 million in an IPO in January. That offering was the biotech sector’s largest this year and the most lucrative IPO since last May. according to BioPharma Dive data. ORI was CG’s top shareholder, owning an 11% stake in the company prior to the offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyverna is the fifth biotech to go public in 2024, and all five have raised at least $100 million. It could be followed by two other drugmakers, Metagenomi and NeoOnc Technologies Holdings, setting a pace of listings that exceeds last year’s so far, according to BioPharma Dive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there are signs of a shift. Newfound optimism in biotech has spurred an early surge in initial public offerings as well as follow-on fundings for public companies. Some industry insiders interviewed by BioPharma Dive have said there’s been an uptick in startup financings, too.\n",

The device is designed to offer enhanced comfort, targeted drug delivery, and therapeutic benefits. Because traditional nozzles often generate discomfort and pain due to the pressure exerted during administration, patients often find it difficult to comply with their therapy, adversely affecting the overall treatment experience. GMT addresses this challenge by using advanced fluid dynamics principles and engineering expertise that focus on a more gentle and effective nasal spray nozzle.\n",

      "Now, the genetic medicines biotech has revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this morning that it’s looking to sell 6.25 million shares priced between $15 and $17 apiece. Assuming the final share price falls in the middle of this range, the raise would bring in $86.9 million in gross proceeds—rising to $100.9 million if underwriters take up their 30-day option to buy an additional 937,500 shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company didn’t share expectations for the offering last month but revealed in an SEC filing this morning that it’s hoping to sell 7.3 million shares for between $14 and $16 apiece. If the final price falls in the middle of that range, the biotech could bring in $99 million—rising to $114.3 million if underwriters seize the 30-day option to buy an additional 1.09 million shares at the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week ago, Actuate confirmed IPO plans to offer 5.5 million shares of common stock priced somewhere between $8 and $10 apiece, with a further 833,333 shares available to underwriters. Assuming the final share price landed at $9, Actuate had estimated this offering would bring in $45.1 million—rising to $52 million if underwriters went all in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pennsylvania-based biotech is offering 8.3 million shares priced between $17 and $19, according to documents filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the final share price lands in the middle of this range, then Arrivent said it expects to bring in $135.7 million from the IPO, boosted to around $156 million if underwriters fully exercise their option to buy an additional 1.2 million shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this week, Artiva set out plans to sell 8.7 million shares priced between $14 and $16 apiece. Assuming the price ended up at $15, this would have brought the company net proceeds of $116 million—rising to $135 million if underwriters took up their 30-day option to buy an additional 1.3 million shares at the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Texas- and Ireland-based company had initially outlined plans in July for a $45.1 million offering but soon reduced this to closer to the $22 million mark. The biotech continued to make some minor amends before settling on its final offer of selling 2.8 million shares priced $8 apiece—the lower end of its anticipated range—it explained in a post-market release yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The expected Nasdaq debut consists of 17,000,000 American depository shares (ADSs), plus a 30-day option for underwriters to purchase up to 15% more ADSs sold in the offering at the initial price, according to a June 5 release. Telix anticipates the net proceeds from the IPO to be around $183 million, or $211 million if the underwriters’ option is exercised in full, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the biotech has set out roughly how much money it hopes it will have to play with. In a June 24 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Alumis said it is aiming to sell 17.6 million shares of its common stock at $17 apiece. This would bring in net proceeds of $274 million—rising to $315.9 million should underwriters take up an offer to buy an additional 2.6 million shares at the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Fractyl Health’s offering —listing 7.3 million shares on the Nasdaq at $15 apiece—is squarely in the middle of the company’s estimates last week. This should bring in $110 million in gross proceeds, which could rise by $16.3 million should underwriters take up their 30-day option to buy an additional 1.09 million shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has priced its 6.25 million shares at $16 apiece, squarely in the middle of the $15 to $17 range the biotech set out in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week. Those gross proceeds could swell to $115 million if underwriters take up the offer of buying an additional 937,500 shares at the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Texas- and Ireland-based biotech first announced in late May its intention to go public, but confirmed its estimates of the finances involved in a July 16 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company is planning to offer 5.5 million shares of common stock priced somewhere between $8 and $10 apiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The radiopharma-focused biotech, which has been listed on the Australian Securities Exchange since 2017, had been due to join the Nasdaq this morning. As recently as last week, Telix said it expected the initial offering to stretch to 17 million American depository shares (ADSs), which would bring in $183 million—or $211 million if underwriters took up the option to buy an additional 15% of ADSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that the final share price falls in the middle of this range, CG said it expects to rake in $181.1 million from the IPO. However, if underwriters jump at the opportunity to snap up a further 1.77 million shares then the haul would rise to $209 million, the biotech explained in a Jan. 18 SEC filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artiva announced its IPO plans on the same day Alumis joined the Nasdaq via a downsized offering. Despite dropping its share price from $17 to $16, the TYK2 inhibitor-focused biotech saw its stock end its first day of trading down 17% at $13.30 —following a trend seen among newly listed biotechs this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that the final price falls in the middle of this range, this will bring the biotech $116.8 million in net proceeds—rising to $135 million if underwriters take up their 30-day option to buy an additional 1.3 million shares at the same price of $15.\n",

      "EXAMPLES:\n",
      "\n",
      "Novo won approval for Ozempic in type 2 diabetes in China in 2021. Evidence that the active ingredient, semaglutide, also supports weight loss has spurred off-label use of the drug in China. Novo is yet to start selling Wegovy, the brand name for semaglutide in obesity and overweight, in the Asian country. The Danish drugmaker could face competition from Chinese rivals, including the Eli Lilly-partnered Innovent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy are made with the same active ingredient, semaglutide, while Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide drug is sold as Zepbound. These, along with liraglutide, are part of a class of medications called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, agonists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eli Lilly plans to launch its diabetes and obesity drug, Mounjaro, in India next year. The drug contains tirzepatide and is sold as Zepbound in the US. The global market for GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Mounjaro, Wegovy, and Ozempic, is expected to reach $100 billion by the end of the decade. Lilly's drugs as well as Danish rival Novo Nordisk's in-demand Wegovy and Ozempic are therapies known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which were developed to control blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Novo Nordisk ’s semaglutide is marketed as Ozempic for type-2 diabetes, and Wegovy for obesity. Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide is called Mounjaro when packaged as a medication for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Semaglutide was developed to treat type 2 diabetes. The drug encourages weight loss, and its use has snowballed since its launch as Ozempic for diabetes in 2017. The drug was also approved for weight management, branded as Wegovy, and released in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been huge demand in the past year for Ozempic and its weight loss-indicated counterpart Wegovy (semaglutide), along with other glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs including Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro (tirzepatide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide), which has led to global shortages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Novo Nordisk has also solidified its dominance in the GLP-1 market with its Type 2 diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic (semaglutide) and Wegovy (also semaglutide), resulting in a 10.8% increase in market capitalisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk make highly effective and popular drugs for diabetes and weight-loss, which belong to a class of treatments known as GLP-1 agonists.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a new weapon could soon be in the armoury – one that could have big implications for the food industry and the battle against obesity. Weight loss drugs, such as Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic for diabetes, are already available on the NHS, and Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, which has been approved for weight loss and, sold as Zepbound, is expected to be available in the UK soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zepbound competes with Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, which works in a similar fashion by stimulating GLP-1 receptors to reduce appetite and slow stomach emptying. Lilly and Novo sell the drug ingredients in Zepbound and Wegovy as, respectively, Mounjaro and Ozempic to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, Wegovy sales were still up 55% from the same period last year as strong demand for the drug persists. Wegovy is approved as a weight loss drug for patients who meet the label criteria. Novo markets a different version of semaglutide as Ozempic to improve glycaemic control and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Ozempic generated $4.2bn in Q2 sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Novo Nordisk was granted approval for semaglutide to be marketed as Wegovy for chronic weight management in June 2021, after being sold for diabetes as Ozempic. Then came Eli Lilly in the fall of 2023 with the approval of tirzepatide as Zepbound, which is also marketed for diabetes as Mounjaro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weight loss therapies like Novo Nordisk ’s Wegovy (semaglutide) and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound (tirzepatide) have been increasing in popularity in recent years. The therapies have generated billions in sales, Novo Nordisk’s obesity drugs, Wegovy and Saxenda (liraglutide), generated Dkr41.6bn ($6bn) in combined global sales in 2023, as per the company’s Q4 financials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The popularity of the GLP-1 RAs is encouraging R&D investment and is driving growth in the metabolic disorder therapy landscape – the fastest growing of any therapy area. Obesity drugs such as Novo Nordisk ’s Ozempic (semaglutide), Wegovy (semaglutide), and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are behind the rapid growth, offering an improved efficacy and safety profile than other anti-obesity medications (such as appetite suppressants and combination drugs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Novo’s portfolio of GLP-1 drugs, which includes Wegovy and the diabetes shot Ozempic, recorded sales of 164.8 billion kroner, with the diabetes side of that business increasing by 52%. Ozempic contains the same active ingredient in Wegovy and is often used off-label as a weight-loss drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "The popularity of GLP-1R drugs has exploded in recent years. Due to their abilities to effectively treat metabolic-related disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, the 11 approved drugs in this category generated $37.2 billion in 2023. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly accounted for nine of these approved products in that year, and encompassed 99% of the sales. Successful GLP-1R products in 2023 included Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy, which generated $13.9 billion and $4.6 billion respectively, as well Eli Lilly’s Trulicity and Mounjaro, which generated $7.1 billion and $5.1 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In late 2017, Novo launched Ozempic—the GLP-1 drug that, while technically for diabetes, put weight-loss shots into the cultural consciousness. Then it rolled out Wegovy, which treats obesity. The two have raked in tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the Danish drugmaker so far. Eli Lilly started selling Zepbound in December last year — a weight-loss shot that’s predicted to become the bestselling drug in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Novo Nordisk announced in June 2024 that it was withdrawing injectable Ozempic (semaglutide) for type 2 diabetes from the Romanian market for “commercial reasons,” leaving only Ozempic oral tablets available for diabetes treatment. Ozempic as an injectable solution in a prefilled pen will cease to be available in Romania after 31 July. Injectable versions of Ozempic have shown a major spike in demand in all markets as a high-profile weight loss treatment, resulting in widespread shortages as Novo attempts to manufacture sufficient supplies.\n",

      "\n",
      "The failure to retain the efficacy signal after making the changes continues a rotten run for developers of essential tremor drug candidates. Neurocrine Biosciences dropped a candidate after seeing phase 2 data in 2022, Praxis Precision Medicines reported a midphase failure in 2023 and Jazz Pharmaceuticals added to the litany of failures in 2024. Praxis moved into phase 3 despite the midphase primary endpoint miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeda’s late-phase epilepsy program has failed a key test, chalking up misses on the primary endpoints in pivotal trials in two indications. But the Japanese drugmaker still plans to talk to regulators about the next steps for the Ovid Therapeutics-partnered prospect based on the “totality of the data.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sabatolimab was the big pipeline news in Novartis’ results but the Swiss drugmaker also shared smaller updates. Novartis is stopping development of the BTK inhibitor remibrutinib in Sjögren’s syndrome but is continuing to advance toward phase 3 data in three other indications. And a HIF2A inhibitor disappeared from Novartis’ pipeline, one month after the company stopped enrollment in a phase 1/1b trial early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors were unmoved by the update, remaining in the funk that began when Ironwood shared phase 3 data on apraglutide one month ago. That study linked apraglutide to improvements in short bowel syndrome (SBS), but investors wanted more and promptly wiped 30% off Ironwood’s share price. The company plans to file for approval in SBS using the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 3 data will shape whether losmapimod can command such a price. The drug failed a phase 2b trial in FSHD in 2021, but Fulcrum looked past the primary endpoint miss and forged ahead into a pivotal study, wrapping up enrollment in September 2023. The biotech’s confidence is based on phase 2b data showing losmapimod may slow disease progression and improve function in FSHD patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enrollment in the trial, ARC-10, began almost three years ago, and the partners were targeting a primary completion date of Aug. 31. The decision to stop the study comes months after leaked data suggested that Roche’s rival TIGIT candidate could improve overall survival in the ARC-10 patient population. Arcus polled (PDF) oncologists after the data leak and learned that most expect the rival drug to win approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minoryx is already working to generate more data in cALD, kicking off a 40-subject phase 3 trial last year as part of its push to clear the bar for authorization set by the FDA, but results are now expected in early 2026. As such, near-term hopes of getting leriglitazone to market rest on the EMA re-examination, a process that enabled Mirati Therapeutics to overturn a decision last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "AstraZeneca stopped work on the molecule in atopic dermatitis one year ago and has seen its peers pull back from the target. GSK dropped its candidate in 2019, and the following year Roche axed a candidate aimed at the IL-33 pathway after seeing asthma data. Sanofi and Regeneron pushed past a setback in phase 2 and powered into a pivotal program in COPD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roche also axed balovaptan, a small-molecule vasopressin V1A receptor antagonist that previously made it to phase 3 in autism spectrum disorder only to fail to move the needle. The drugmaker tried again in the aftermath of the failure, kicking off a phase 2 study in post-traumatic stress disorder. Roche finished that trial last year and promptly removed balovaptan from its pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeda’s narcolepsy work has finally yielded a phase 2b win, albeit with a blemish. After axing one asset over liver toxicity, the Japanese drugmaker’s continued faith in the mechanism has been rewarded with a primary endpoint hit —but the midphase program only supports progression in one form of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilead is poised to take the baton from Xilio and carry XTX301 through the rest of the race against those rivals. The transfer will leave Xilio focused on its CTLA-4 prospect XTX101, phase 2 data on which are due later this year. Xilio has a third clinical-phase asset, the IL-2 candidate XTX202, but it has decided to stop investing in monotherapy development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironwood Pharmaceuticals’ $1 billion short bowel syndrome (SBS) bet has delivered a phase 3 win—and wiped 30% off the company’s share price. While the study met its primary endpoint, the results failed to convince investors it can win out over Takeda’s Gattex, its potential generic copies and Zealand Pharma’s glepaglutide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exscientia deprioritized its cancer drug EXS-21546 after early-stage trials. BenevolentAI shelved its drug candidate for atopic dermatitis after seeing mixed results in a phase 2 trial. And Sumitomo Pharma saw its AI-identified treatment for schizophrenia, ulotaront, fall short of its primary endpoints in phase 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result caused the trial to miss its primary endpoint. That is a problem for GlycoMimetics. The biotech weathered setbacks such as the failure of its Pfizer-partnered sickle cell disease prospect and loss of the Big Pharma bedfellow to emerge with a pipeline focused on uproleselan. The next most advanced asset, a successor to the candidate Pfizer dropped, cleared phase 1a in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "The failure came months after venglustat missed the mark in a phase 2 Parkinson’s disease study. While the failures dented Sanofi’s “pipeline in a pill” ambitions, work continued in GM2 gangliosidosis, Gaucher disease type 3 and Fabry disease. Thursday, Sanofi crossed GM2 off the list of active indications “based on the absence of positive trends on clinical endpoints.”\n",
      "\n",
      "AR-15512 failed to improve tear production or ocular discomfort on day 28 in an earlier study, causing that trial to miss its co-primary endpoints. Aerie looked past the setback, focused on successes against secondary goals—including tear production at day 14—designed a phase 3 program around the lessons of the earlier trial and was rewarded with a buyout bid from Alcon, plus positive top-line phase 3 data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jazz Pharmaceuticals hit a bum note Thursday, reporting the failure of a phase 2b essential tremor trial to meet its primary endpoint. But the drugmaker saw numeric improvements and is waiting on the data from another study rather than immediately bringing the curtain down on the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the usual caveat that cross-trial comparisons can be unreliable, particularly when comparing phase 2 data with phase 3 results, the readout suggests povorcitinib may deliver competitive efficacy. Incyte has given up a head start to Dupixent, which won FDA approval in 2022, but the company sees benefits to following rather than leading.\n",

The company plans to present more detailed results from both studies at upcoming medical meetings, and to engage with regulators about the path to approval in gMG.\n",

      "Yet Akero has reported mixed results. The drug succeeded in the mid-stage study it updated on Monday, which tested efruxifermin in people with stage 2 or 3 fibrosis.

      "In other psychedelics news, Atai Life Sciences reported positive results from a small study testing its version of “DMT,” a hallucinogenic drug similar to tryptamine. The trial enrolled healthy volunteers, and its main focus, rather than effectiveness, was safety, tolerability, and how the body reacts to and metabolizes the drug. According to Atai, the drug was well-tolerated and appeared to work as designed, inducing a short psychedelic experience that generally subsided within two hours. A mid-stage study evaluating it in people with treatment-resistant depression should begin around the end of this year. — Jacob Bell\n",

      "The drug, dubbed elinzanetant, has already succeeded in two late-stage studies testing its ability to reduce the frequency of hot flashes and improve sleep in menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms.

      "The biotechnology company shared its plans alongside results from a placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the drug, dubbed WVE-003.

      "Relatedly, CureVac estimates its restructuring efforts will curb operational expenses more than 30% from 2025 onward. The company expects to incur a one-time restructuring charge of 15 million euros, which includes employee severance, benefits and related costs. But that charge should be offset, as personnel costs are slated to drop by approximately 25 million euros.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specific figure disclosed Wednesday morning adds clarity to the savings goal unveiled in November 2023—to bring general expenses and R&D costs below $750 million in 2024, a greater than 50% reduction from 2022 levels. The figure included $300 million in new reductions, the majority of which came from general expenses and R&D with an additional $100 million from reduced supply chain spending. Novavax announced in May that 25% of the team would be laid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeking to stretch its $175 million cash pile into the second half of 2026, the biotech is laying off around 20 people. The 35% reduction in headcount will mainly affect drug discovery positions, although “select employees working in development and general and administrative functions” also face the chop. The layoffs will leave Ikena with around 37 full-time employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marinus ended March with $113.3 million in cash and equivalents. The company had previously expected its financial fuel to run out by the end of 2024, but the biotech said the package of cost reductions means it should be able to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025, including maintaining a minimum bank balance of $15 million as required by its debt facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Massachusetts-based biotech announced the downsizing in an SEC filing where Aerovate said it expects to incur costs of about $5.6m related to the layoffs. These costs are expected to be incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. The company also added that it expects all of its workforce to be cut in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viracta is pausing its solid tumor program and making layoffs that will affect around 23% of employees. The biotech ended March with 40 full-time employees, 30 of whom worked in R&D. Viracta had $30 million at the end of June, a sum it expects to fund operations late into the first quarter of 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The company expects to undergo a restructuring to align resources with the streamlined pipeline, which will include a workforce reduction of approximately 25% and an estimated extension of the cash runway into the second quarter of 2026,” the company said in the June 12 release.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the cash savings initiative, Aadi is also reducing its research & development headcount by 80%. The pipeline and workforce restructure are expected to extend Aadi’s cash runway into H2 2026. The company reported cash reserves of $78.6m as of 30 June 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company stated it expects to incur charges of $1.5m–$2m relating to the restructuring, consisting of one-time cash payments for termination benefits. Repare expects to execute most of its plan by Q3 this year, saving around $15m annually that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company plans to fire 25% of its staff, which along with other cash reduction measures is expected to save Cue Biopharma $30m in operating expenses next year. The company added that following the restructuring its cash runway will extend to mid-2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barinthus is not the only company to trim its workforce this year. Senti Bio cut 37% of its employees in January in an attempt to extend its cash runway, followed by Xilio firing 21% of its workforce in a pipeline reprioritisation effort. Most recently, Erasca reduced its headcount by around 18% after shutting down three clinical programmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADC Therapeutics ended 2023 with $278.5 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, money that is expected to stretch into the fourth quarter of 2025. The company expects its belt-tightening to cut total operating expenses for both 2023 and 2024 in comparison to 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effort—which began in late 2023 and was announced during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings release this week—will include layoffs affecting about 3% of the company’s current international head count of more than 18,000. In addition to other inventory reduction initiatives, the moves are expected to cost between $125 million and $150 million through the end of 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lack of near-term funding necessitated this difficult step to fortify our balance sheet and cash position, which unfortunately means an impact to our workforce,” said CEO Andrew Allen, in a Thursday statement announcing the restructuring. The company had 233 full-time employees at the end of 2022, according to its last annual report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restructure is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year and slash recurring costs by 40%, or $75 million annually. As of June 30, UniQure had $524 million on hand, money expected to stretch to the end of 2027, according to the company release.\n",
      "\n",
      "These “strategic measures” include laying off around 25% of the company’s staff across its R&D and general and administrative resources teams. Combined with “the implementation of focused operational efficiencies,” these moves are expected to pave a cash runway into the middle of next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program is expected to save about $40 million annually beginning in 2025, with expected severance and termination costs between approximately $7.4 million and $9.6 million, according to the company’s Tuesday morning earnings release. The charges will be recorded in the second quarter and stretch through the rest of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headcount reduction will affect 30% of its workforce when planned 2024 hires are factored in, Grail said. The restructuring will take place in the third and fourth quarters, resulting in a charge from $18 million to $23 million in the third quarter for severance and other termination-related costs.\n",
