# SturdyStatsExamples

This repository contains a collection of jupyter notebooks and simple web demos (`dash`) that make use of the [Sturdy Statistics Text API](https://sturdystatistics.com/api/documentation).

The notebooks go into step by step detail on how to use the api. The notebooks also dive into the internals of Sturdy Statistics model and by extension, into their analytical capabilities.

The web demos provide a series of interactive visualizations by which you can explore your data. They provide examples of how to interact with the api through a front end/web interface.
